**Optimally Interpolating between Ex-Ante Fairness and Welfare** *

Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, Panagiotis Karras, *<u>**Wenyue Ma**</u>*, Nidhi Rathi, Chris Schwiegelshohn [code] 

***Summary***: In this work, we consider ex-ante notions of fairness; popular examples include the randomized round-robin algorithm and sortition mechanism. We propose a general framework to systematically study the interpolation between fairness and welfare goals in a multi-criteria setting.

*Under Submission (2023)*

**Revisiting in Influence Maximization**
  
*<u>**Wenyue Ma**</u>*, Maximilian Egger, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Panagiotis Karras [code]

***Summary***: How can we ensure an information dissemination campaign reaches all segments of society? Past research has proposed heuristics tailored to this objective, which, however, fail when the promotion budget is low. In this paper, we propose novel reachability-based heuristics that cater to low-budget settings.
